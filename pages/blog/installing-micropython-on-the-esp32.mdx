# Installing MicroPython on the ESP32 (macOS)

Recently, I've been tinkering around with MicroPython on an Adafruit Huzzah32 (a board with the ESP32 chip). MicroPython has a strong ecosystem of libraries and has allowed me to prototype much faster than using the typical Arduino Editor. This is a quick guide on getting started with the firmware on MacOS.

## Installing the Firmware

1. Download the SiLabs USBâ†’UART drivers from [https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers). This is required to communicate with the board from a Mac.
2. Download the MicroPython firmware from [https://micropython.org/download/esp32/](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/). I downloaded the latest generic firmware with ESP-IDF v3.x for my Adafruit Huzzah32.
3. Next, install ESPTool. This will allow us to flash the firmware to the board.

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade esptool
    ```

4. Erase the existing firmware from the board. The port argument is `/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART` for MacOS, this is different on other platforms.

    ```bash
     esptool.py --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART erase_flash
    ```

5. Install the new firmware:

    ```bash
    esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART write_flash -z 0x1000 <PATH_TO_YOUR_BIN_FILE>
    ```

6. The firmware should now be installed on your board ðŸŽ‰You can open a Python shell on the board using `screen`. To exit the session type (Ctrl-A Ctrl-\\)

    ```bash
    screen /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART 115200
    ```

## Uploading Code to the board

Most of the tutorials I followed stopped here - but I still didn't know how to actually upload code to the board. We can use a tool from Adafruit called `ampy` to manage the files on device. Install the pip package:

```bash
pip install adafruit-ampy
```

To upload code to the board simply create a `.py` file and then use ampy:

```bash
ampy -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART put <your .py file>
```

> Note: You must close any screen sessions before attempting to upload a file.

The final step to run your code is to open a screen session and import the file you uploaded:
```bash
import <your file name>.py
```

After you've verified that your code works, you can rename it to `main.py` **to have it run when the board boots.
