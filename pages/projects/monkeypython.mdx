  # Monkey Python

  This robot's purpose was to shoot foam dodgeballs (known as boulders) into goals and cross various types
  of rough terrain challenges. I oversaw the overall design of the robot and designed the robots boulder
  intake mechanism.

  ## The Game
  FIRST STRONGHOLD is played by two alliances of three teams each. Alliances compete against each other to breach their opponents’ defenses, known as outer works, and capture their tower. They score points by crossing elements of their opponents’ outer works, scoring boulders in their opponents’ tower goals, and surrounding and scaling their opponents’ tower itself.

  ## Design Highlights
  I was in charge of designing the boulder intake mechanism on Monkey Python. This consisted of a structure that had to fold out of the robot to intake the foam dodge balls so the robot could shoot them into the goals on the field. At the same time, I also designed the geometry of the intake to be able to manipulate the rough terrain challenges such as lifting up trap doors and pushing down a balance.

  ### Why Mecanum Wheels?
  I wanted the intake to be able to pick up boulders anywhere in front of the robot so that it would be easier for the drivers on the field. I decided to use Mecanum wheels (which are typically used for multidirectional movement) to funnel the balls towards the center of the intake. I mounted the wheels on the ends of the inner and outer shafts so that the boulders would be in contact with the bumpers and the wheels when collecting from the side. With this design, I maintained both the extended reach and the ability to collect from the corners of the robot.

  ### Intake Arm Gearbox
  I needed the intake arm to stop at several points to manipulate the rough terrain challenges. I decided to use bevel gears to mount the motor perpendicular to the arm’s axis of rotation to keep it from interfering with the bumpers. In early testing of the intake, we broke the bevel gears on the intake arm gearbox in a software failure. Before replacing the gears, I decided to analyze the strength of the gears to ensure that they would not fail during normal operation. I was surprised to discover that the brass material on the bevel gears was actually weaker than the surface treated 7075 Aluminum spur gears.

  *Calculation of max load on each gear*

  As the bevel gears were almost 5 times weaker than the spur gears, I decided to add an additional spur gear stage before the bevel gears so there would be less load on the bevel gear.
