  ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Srinjoy! I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft building AR apps for the Hololens.
  This past year, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

  At UT, I conducted computer vision research in the Human-Robot Interaction domain under Dr. Andrea Thomaz and Dr. Scott Niekum.

  Previously, I worked part-time as a Software Engineer at GitHub. I worked on various projects such as developing [GitHub Classroom](https://github.com/srinjoym/classroom)
