# srinjoy.me

Source code for my personal website written using React and Next JS. I wrote the first version of my website over 7 years ago when I was in high school ðŸ¤¯ It was one of my first programming projects and I've been tinkering with it ever since. I recently rewrote this website from the group up to run on Next JS and Chakra UI. The previous version of this website is [here](https://github.com/srinjoym/srinjoy.me). 

Feel free to take inspiration from the design or code base. It's live at www.srinjoy.me
